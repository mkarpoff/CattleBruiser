Problem Codes:
1 - Selects Wrong Choke Point
2 - Zealots don't fall for the block without a Marine
3 - Probes don't fall for the block without a Marine
4 - Positioning is off slightly
5 - Too Wide to Choke
6 - Blockers leave too late, due to no early scouting

Benzene - 1
Destination - 1
Heartbreak Ridge - 2
Aztec - 4, 6

Empire of the Sun - 5, 6
Foretress - 5, 6
Python - 5, 6 

Individual Map Comments:

Heartbreak Ridge - Unsure why it fails but I believe it's due to how the Chokepoint is located. 
Need a marine there ASAP or it won't be viable.

Andromeda - The choke is never attempted since the point it calculates is 7 wide even though there is a perfectly usable ramp to block.

Empire of the Sun - The choke is calculated to be 4 SCV's wide.
It MIGHT be worth attempting but it likely suffers from the same problems as Heartbreak Ridge.
